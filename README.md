# Vanilla Steel Inventory 

##Task 1 objective - Clean and join the datasets into a single inventory_dataset 
##The following datasets are raw materials provided by two suppliers (Company A GmbH and Company B Gmbh). 

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named `Task_1 (1).ipynb`. This notebook focuses on data extraction, cleaning, and analysis using Python and Pandas. It primarily works with supplier data stored in Excel files and performs EDA.

## What This Notebook Does
- Mounts Google Drive to access datasets which is needed when you work withh collab.
- Loads supplier data from Excel files (`supplier_data_1.xlsx` and `supplier_data_2.xlsx`).
- Uses Pandas for data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Displays dataset details for further analysis.

## Features
- Data loading and validation, checking for null values and head
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Installation
To use this notebook, follow these steps:

1.open gogle collab, make sure that the drive is mounted.
2.Add the excel sheet on google drive, to make sure that you can retrive data.
3.Once this step is done move further on collab for data analyasis.

## Data and further steps 
- The notebook uses supplier data stored in Excel files.
- Ensure the dataset files (`supplier_data_1.xlsx` and `supplier_data_2.xlsx`) are available in the correct location.
- Use the .ipynb file which mentions all the steps and python code which is need for EDA.
