# Project Title

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook named `Task_1 (1).ipynb`. This notebook focuses on data extraction, cleaning, and analysis using Python and Pandas. It primarily works with supplier data stored in Excel files and performs initial data exploration.

## What This Notebook Does
- Mounts Google Drive to access datasets.
- Loads supplier data from Excel files (`supplier_data_1.xlsx` and `supplier_data_2.xlsx`).
- Uses Pandas for data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Displays dataset details for further analysis.

## Features
- Data loading and validation.
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Installation
To use this notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Task_1 (1).ipynb`).
2. Run the cells step by step.
3. Ensure Google Drive is mounted correctly.
4. Verify the dataset paths before running data processing steps.

## Data
- The notebook uses supplier data stored in Excel files.
- Ensure the dataset files (`supplier_data_1.xlsx` and `supplier_data_2.xlsx`) are available in the correct location.

## Dependencies
The required libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
